This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## AI Article Generation Workflow

This project includes a workflow for generating libertarian analysis articles based on news URLs using AI, previewing them, and publishing them as static content.

### User Flow

1.  **Generate:** Navigate to `/generate`.
    *   Enter a news article URL (e.g., from NOS).
    *   Select an inspiring thinker (e.g., Ayn Rand, Ludwig von Mises).
    *   Optionally add extra instructions for the AI.
    *   Click "Genereer Concept".
2.  **Preview:** The application calls the `/api/generate` endpoint.
    *   Upon successful generation, the user is automatically redirected to `/generate/preview`.
    *   The preview page displays the AI-generated content (Title, Date, Tags, Spin, Analyses, Thinker, Quote) in a structured format.
3.  **Publish:** Review the generated article on the preview page.
    *   If satisfied, click "âœ“ Publish Article".
    *   This sends the article data to the `/api/publish` endpoint.
    *   The API saves the article as an `.mdx` file in the `content/articles/` directory (locally).
    *   A success or error message is displayed on the preview page.

### Technical Details

*   **Generation Page (`app/generate/page.tsx`):**
    *   A React client component with a form to input URL, select thinker, and add instructions.
    *   On submit, constructs a detailed prompt including the thinker's perspective and required JSON structure.
    *   Calls the `/api/generate` endpoint with the prompt.
    *   Handles the response, parses the generated JSON data, and redirects to the preview page using `next/navigation`'s `useRouter`.
*   **Generation API (`/api/generate`):**
    *   *Assumption:* This existing serverless function takes a prompt, interacts with an AI service (like OpenAI), and returns the structured article content as a JSON string within a `response` field.
*   **Preview Page (`pages/generate/preview.tsx`):**
    *   Retrieves the stringified article JSON from the URL query parameters using `next/router`'s `useRouter`.
    *   Parses the JSON and displays the article fields.
    *   Contains the "Publish Article" button.
    *   Calls the `/api/publish` endpoint on button click.
    *   Displays status messages (loading, success, error) for the publish action.
*   **Publish API (`app/api/publish/route.ts`):**
    *   A Next.js API Route Handler (App Router).
    *   Accepts a `POST` request with the article data (JSON body).
    *   Validates the incoming data.
    *   Formats the data into an MDX string with YAML frontmatter and content sections.
    *   Uses Node.js `fs` and `path` modules to write the MDX content to a file named `{slug}.mdx` within the `content/articles/` directory.
    *   Creates the `content/articles/` directory if it doesn't exist.
    *   Returns a JSON response indicating success or failure.
    *   *Note:* The `fs.writeFileSync` will only work in environments with filesystem write access (like local development). For serverless deployments (Vercel, Netlify), a different strategy (e.g., GitHub API) is required.
